# USG-RSysLog-Server
Python based Remote Syslog server for Unifi USG 

This is a simple python application that takes accepts the events coming from the Unifi USG firewall.
The purpse is to quickly parse the event messages, convert them to JSON and then pass the messages to an ELK instance for log analysis

There are some configuration parameters that will need to be set.

I will create a screen shot approach to setting up the overall solution.

Enjoy
